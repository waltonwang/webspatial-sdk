## 2D Web Developers

If you are a 2D Web developer, WebSpatial lowers the **threshold** and **cost** of building spatial apps to almost nothing for you (especially when you already have an existing Web App project).

Although spatial-computing platforms and XR devices (including Vision Pro-like head-mounted displays that are becoming lighter and more affordable, and AI/AR glasses whose UI capabilities are about to grow rapidly) do not yet have the same large user base as desktop or mobile platforms, WebSpatial’s **cross-platform support** and **low adaptation cost** let you confidently enter these next-generation platforms early. You can keep exploring and practicing user experience, UI design, functionality, and usage scenarios while gaining insight. When the platform or a particular application domain takes off, you will be ready to participate from day one.

You can publish your existing Web App **in the spatial-computing platform’s app store**, gaining greater exposure, reputation, and sharing opportunities in a **less-competitive environment that is closer to some users**.

You can turn your existing Web App into an **“ultra-large-screen” experience** on spatial-computing platforms, fully leveraging the larger space to simplify the UI and enhance content.

You can enrich your existing Web App with **more vivid and attractive 3D content and a 3D GUI** on spatial-computing platforms.

You can give your existing Web App **more natural and diverse interaction methods** on spatial-computing platforms.

You can also activate **brand-new features and use cases designed specifically for XR scenarios**, unlocking new possibilities for your existing Web App on spatial-computing platforms.

Once you are familiar with the API, you can create **entirely new apps for spatial-computing platforms at similarly low cost** while preserving cross-platform compatibility for desktop and mobile, **serving every user group**.

## Native Spatial-App Developers

If you are a native spatial-app developer, you can follow **mobile-internet best practices** by embedding a **WebView container powered by WebSpatial** in your native spatial app and letting the Web developers on your team maintain a lot of **dynamic content and frequently updated GUI**.

These Web developers can implement not only 2D content and GUI but also meet product and design requirements that involve 3D and spatial capabilities, making this **productivity-boosting workflow** suitable for most scenarios.

## Web 3D Developers

If you are a 3D developer, especially a Web 3D developer, your existing 3D skills now have **far more opportunities and a larger stage**.

Previously, these 3D skills could be used only in a limited number of 3D-game scenarios; and because traditional 3D apps on XR platforms occupy the entire space, you had to make the app support the entire user scenario on its own, fully satisfying the user’s needs and driving retention and engagement by yourself. This resulted in high implementation costs and revenue pressure.

With WebSpatial, you can take part in **the much broader, user-friendly, everyday Shared Space mode and multi-app scenarios**. In every **3D container within spatial apps that use a 2D GUI architecture**, your 3D work becomes the stage. The 3D effects and content you create can **appear in more places, reach more users, and stay closer to them**.

You also **do not need to carry the entire user scenario alone** anymore. You can develop widgets, companion apps, helper tools, on-demand apps, social mini-games, and many other types of applications. They are inexpensive to build and quick to iterate, allowing you to **experiment with more ideas and meet more user needs**.

Even though version 1 of WebSpatial has not officially provided a 3D-engine API yet, you can **still let your existing WebXR games benefit from WebSpatial**:

WebXR content is well suited to be used together with 2D web content. For example, a service-based game’s portal, lobby, item trading, and leaderboard features can all be implemented more efficiently and be more shareable in 2D webpages than through a 3D graphics API.

However, these 2D webpage interfaces were previously confined to flat windows with uniform backgrounds and borders, making them disjointed and inconsistent with the borderless WebXR interface and limiting their capabilities. As soon as 3D content needed to be added, you had to switch from the webpage to WebXR to implement it.

With WebSpatial, these **2D webpages that accompany WebXR games** can place UI in space like WebXR content, embed 3D content, and adopt a design language and theme similar to WebXR, while still allowing the user to start a WebXR session with a single click. You can **switch freely between WebXR mode and WebSpatial mode** at any time.
